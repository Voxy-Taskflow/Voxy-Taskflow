## 💭 Why I Code  
The magic of being able to build *anything I can imagine* in a digital world is what pulled me into coding — and what keeps me going is learning something new every single day. It’s not just about tech, it’s about creating tools that make life better for me and everyone around me.

## 🔧 What I’m Building

### 🧠 **TaskFlow AI** *(Passion Project)*  
> Started as a dream — now it's becoming a full-blown AI system capable of breaking down tasks, managing sub-agents, and automating workflows.  
I’m working toward a version that **doesn’t rely on existing open-source AI agents** — so I can one day integrate it into **my own OS** and have the system *just work*.  
> Think **“Mannyus AI”**, but mine can do everything.

### 🖥️ **Custom Operating System**  
> A personal challenge to understand and build technology from the ground up.  
This OS will eventually support TaskFlow AI and serve as the foundation for future tools — a self-reliant, full-stack system.

### 🌍 **Open-World Fantasy Game**  
Inspired by **Elden Ring** and **Assassin’s Creed**, I’m building a magical medieval village with elemental bosses, rich lore, and quests that matter.  
Still deciding between **Unity (C#)** or Unreal Engine — but the world’s already forming.

## 🧪 Highlight Project

### ✨ TaskFlow AI  
> My proudest achievement — it’s the kind of project that teaches you *everything* about thinking big, breaking it down, and building piece by piece.

## 🌟 A Little About Me  
- 🎮 Gamer | 🎧 Music Lover | 👟 Long walks fan  
- 🤝 I chose biology in 12th — not because I didn’t know coding, but because I *already did* and wanted something new  
- 🎯 Dream: Land an internship with **Linux Foundation**, and build a dev environment that's *mine from the ground up*  
- 🧠 When I’m not building, I’m watching random YouTube rabbit holes or vibing with friends
